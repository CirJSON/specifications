\section{Scope}

CirJSON is a lightweight, text-based, language-independent syntax for defining data interchange formats.
It was derived from the JSON data interchange format, and is programming language independent.
CirJSON defines a small set of structuring rules for the portable representation of structured data.

The goal of this specification is only to define the syntax of valid CirJSON texts.
Its intent is not to provide any semantics or interpretation of text conforming to that syntax.
It also intentionally does not define how a valid CirJSON text might be internalized into the data structures of a programming language.
There are many possible semantics that could be applied to the CirJSON syntax and many ways that a CirJSON text can be processed or
mapped by a programming language.
Meaningful interchange of information using CirJSON requires agreement among the involved parties on the specific semantics to be applied.
Defining specific semantic interpretations of CirJSON is potentially a topic for other specifications.
